# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification with AI  

🔍 This project is a deep learning-based brain tumor classification system using MRI images.  
It detects and classifies brain tumors into four categories:  

- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary Tumor  
- No Tumor  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Uses deep learning (TensorFlow & Keras) for tumor detection  
✔ Supports image upload for MRI scans  
✔ Provides real-time classification with confidence score  
✔ Interactive Streamlit web app  
✔ Simple UI for ease of use
